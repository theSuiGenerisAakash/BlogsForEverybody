# Bfore

“Blogs for Everybody!” is a minimalist blog cum notepad which has simple
user interface and simpler authentication. From the hassles of storing and sharing
a scribble to penning down text articles with or without some handshake
protection is what has been the intent behind designing this application.
Built on MEAN stack, scalability or extensibility would hardly be an issue in future
where we expect to take along this project.

## Overview

This online submission system supports following users
a. Poster
b. Peer

Functionalities for a Poster
i. Save & share his writings with anyone he wishes to. All he needs to do is
share the ‘secret code’.
ii. Revisit his blogs/scribbles to attend to the recent comments
iii. Edit his previous posts through the use of a second ‘secret code’ (for
authentication).

Functionalities of a Peer
i. View any of the posts of which he has the code.
ii. Comment on those posts.

The best part about this is that a peer and a poster can be a peer and poster!
